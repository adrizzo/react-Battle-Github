# react-Battle-Github
A quick test / practice for a mini app that takes Users from the Github API and puts them into a deadly battle to know who got more skills 
( or social success ) in the Github community.

Project created from scratch without create-react-app (yes, we are learning over here)

DEMO (source code needs to be updated)
